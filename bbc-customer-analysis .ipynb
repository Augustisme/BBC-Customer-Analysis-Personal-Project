The first goal of this project is to use SQL to define: \n    - The first 2 serviceid customers used and Date that customer used those services.\n    - The last serviceid users used and Date that users used that service.\n    - The total distinct serviceid that customers used.\n    - Present the findings into one table with the columns as follows:\n \n    \n| User_id  | FirstServiceid | SecondServiceid | FirstServiceDate | SecondServiceDate | LastServiceid | LastServiceDate | TotalService |\n| -------- | -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------ |\n| 407901   | 12  |  45 | 1-Jan-18 | 2-Jan-18 | 667 | 22-July-2018| 6 |\n    \n   \n    \n2. The second goal is identifying patterns using Python to answer the business questions below.\n\n## Business question\n1. Determine whether customers in different BBC ages have different serviceid cluster?\n2. Determine which serviceid we can cross-sell to customers? Give recommendation to your findings.\n\n## Database description\nWe have one table `test` with three columns `User_id`, `Date`, and `Serviceid`.\n\n- **User_id**: The identity of the individual customer.\n- **Servicedid**: The identity of the transaction.\n- **Date**: the date that transaction is performed.\n\n_Note: This is the open data._","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# PROCESS\nDoing SQL query to find the answer for the first goal, we use the combination of three `CTE`s to find the answer for `The first 2 serviceid`, `last serviceid` csutomers used and `Date` \n\nCombine with `COUNT` statement to find the total distinct serviceid that customers used.
